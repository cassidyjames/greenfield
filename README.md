Experimental GTK stylesheet from scratch

## Goals

- **Not to be used as a day-to-day stylesheet**
- Learn some more GTK styling
- Use `em`s to keep anything related to text based on the font size
- Use `px` to define strokes
- Write and design with dark styling a consideration from the start

## Testing

Just run `./install.sh` which will create a symlink to the stylesheet in your local themes folder. To revert, run `./uninstall.sh`.
