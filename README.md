Experimental GTK stylesheet from scratch. Inspired in a lot of ways by (and intended to eventually be compatible with) the [elementary OS stylesheet](https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet), but not intended to be a lookalike, replacement, or new version in any way.

## Goals

- **Not to be used as a day-to-day stylesheet**
- Learn some more GTK styling
- Experiment using `em`s to keep anything related to text based on the font size
- Use `px` to define strokes
- Write and design with dark styling a consideration from the start
- Break the styles into the components for easier maintenance
- Play with a build system

## Testing

Just run `./install.sh` which will create a symlink to the stylesheet in your local themes folder. To revert, run `./uninstall.sh`.
